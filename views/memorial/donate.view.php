    <p>An option is to set up a paypal account for donations. This seems a popular route to use.
        Perhaps we could also consider
        <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/" target="_blank">crowdfunding?</a></p>
    <p>The donate button below doesn't currently do anything but could hyperlink to paypal, or there could be separate
        buttons to various donation vehicles</p><br>

    <a href="/donate" class="donatexl">Donate</a><br><br>
